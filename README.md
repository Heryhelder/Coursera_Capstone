# Car accident data analysis

This projects aims to predict the severity level of a car accident, based on previous data. We are going to use the techniques learned in the course to read, clean and handle data, then check for correlations with the target variable, after that to create a Machine Learn model that aims to proccess the data and can be used for future predicts. In the end, we can check the accuracy of each model and select the best one.

## Requirements
* Python
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy

## Next Steps:
Handle datetime features (maybe plot it against the target variable)
Learn how to use datetime in Machine Learning algorithms

This is the last project for the [Data Science course by IBM on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)
